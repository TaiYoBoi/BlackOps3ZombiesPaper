<p><font color="red"><h2>COMMENT</h2></font>You'd never consciously notice it, but look again at the very brightest portion of the background! See that shape
that descends? This is precisely what Barthes is after--a detail that makes us find an obvious representation "real."</p><p>
Barthes describes such images as follows: <font color="red"><h2>QUOTE FROM THE READINGS</h2></font>"the singularity of the descriptive (or of the 'useless detail') in the
narrative fabric, its isolatedness, brings up a question of primary importance for the structural analysis of narrative" <font color="red"><h2>CITATION</h2></font><font color=green>(Barthes, "The Reality Effect" p. 12).</font>
