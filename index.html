<p><h3><font color="black"><h2>TITLE</h2></font>Black Ops Zombies: The Need for Survival</h3></p>
  
<p><font color="black"><h2>Game Information</h2></font>Black Ops 3 Zombies is a separate game mode from the game Black Ops 3. The point of BO3 Zombies is to survive endless waves of zombies and maneuver your character 
around the waves of endless enemies that come your way. Though the games has many maps which has there own story, I want to only highlight the main point of the game, which is to survive.</p>

<p><font color="black"><h2>THESIS STATEMENT</h2></font>Anzieu briefly mentions about the death drive and the life drive and how there are specific reasons for cries. Throughout the game, there are many sounds from the zombies that are truly terrifying and often very 
scary but when reaching death, the character does not cry out. Take a look at the death scene of the game below. There is no true ending to the game zombies but it is still highly played by many people. The game is in many ways a strategy game in which knowing how to 
maneuver around the level and knowing which powerups to use to escape trouble is very important. The game requires proactive movements and awareness to ensure survival till the next wave. Lindley explains that one of the main reasons of play is the pleasure in vigorous activity.</p>

<p><font color="black"><h2>COMMENT</h2></font>As seen from this clip, the character does not even make a sound when injured. From the point of game, it would take away the immersion of the 
game when playing from the first-person point of view. The way the character moves depends on the player which immerses the player with the character and lets the player see what the charcter sees. 
This makes the game feel more real for the player and lets them react from this perpesctive instead. In a way the character and the player are connected or "sutured." The game also would make it hard to be reactive to the environment 
if we could hear the character's breathing. Sound is very important to the game since hearing zombies from every corner is an important aspect of the game to know where to run away from. In a survival aspect, there is the mention of the death drive that Anzieu mentions. The
preservation of life is a key aspect to the game and the sounds that we hear from the game threatens the player and ensures that the player should avoid to survive.

<p>"to "stand in" for it, or by allowing a particular point of view to define what it sees. The operation of suture is successful at the moment that the viewing subject 
says, "Yes, that's me," or "That's what I see." (Silverman, Kaja. "Suture" pg 6)</p>
<p>"the result is a defusing of the drives, freeing the death drives and giving them economic predominance over the life drives."(Anzieu, "The Sound Envelop" in The Skin Ego pg. 169)
